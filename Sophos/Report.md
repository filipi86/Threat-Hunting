# Introduction

> The purpose of this document, it was to execute several efficiency and
> detection tests in our endpoint solution, provided by Sophos, this
> document brings the result of the defensive security analysis with an
> offensive mindset performed in the execution of 27 folders download
> with **Malwares by The Zoo** repository in our environment.
>
> Regarding the test performed, the first objective it was to simulate
> targeted attacks using known malware to obtain a panoramic view of the
> resilience presented by the solution, with regard to the efficiency in
> its detection by signatures, downloading these artifacts directly on
> the victim\'s machine. The second objective consisted of analyzing the
> detection of those same 27 folders download with Malwares (or those
> not detected yet) when they were changed directories, the idea here is
> to work with manipulation of samples (without execution), and the
> third focal objective it was the execution of a *ScanNow* inside
> victim\'s machines for effectiveness analysis.
>
> With the final product, the front responsible for the product will
> have an instrument capable of guiding a process of mitigation and / or
> correction, as well as optimized improvement, based on the criticality
> of risks.

## Scope

> The efficiency and detection analysis had as target the Cybereason
> Endpoint Protection application (https://cloud.sophos.com) in

## Project Summary 

> The execution of the security analysis tests of the Threat Hunting
> team it was carried out through the execution of 42 Malwares in a
> virtualized environment in a controlled way, simulating a real
> environment, together with their respective best practices of the
> security policies applied, the test occurred during **2 days**,
> without count the weekend, along with the making of this document. The
> intrusion test started on the **24th of September** of the year 2020
> and it was completed on the **28th of September** of the same year.

#  Running the Tests

### 3.1 Description

> A virtual machine with Windows 10 operating system it was deployed to
> perform the appropriate tests, as well as the creation of a security
> policy on the management platform (Threat-Hunting--Win10-POC) e and
> applied to due device.

> **Image 1.2:** Virtual Machine with Policy applied
>
> The policy created was named **Threat-Hunting--Win10-POC**, following
> the best practices recommended by the manufacturer, and, for testing
> purposes, all due actions were based on an aggressive detection
> method.

> **Image 1.3:** Policy created by Sophos Central

### 3.2 First Test 

> The first stage of the tests was through the download of 27 folders
> with many different kind of malwares, all of which are already known
> to be older, all of them are in the public repository known and
> maintained by the security community called **The Zoo**
> (<https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo/tree/master/malwares/Binaries>);

> **Image 1.4:** Download 27 Folders with malicious files
>
> The purpose of this test was to simulate the same process as a user
> receiving a zipped file (.zip) and performing the extraction of these
> artifacts in their own environment.

> **Image 1.5:** Extraction of 26 Folders with malicious files
>
> After performing the action of extracting the files, it was possible
> to verify that Sophos Security Endpoint there were currently **4
> (four) Malwares** that, when executed inside the environment, could
> perform an infection.

### 3.3 Second Test 

> The second stage of the tests was through the transfer of folders to
> another directory within the same machine, the purpose of this test
> was to simulate a transfer of files within the same environment.

> **Image 1.7: \_\_**NEW_FOLDER\_\_(Sophoo) -- Malware manipulation
>
> When a new file is generated on the disk, soon we should have a new
> entry in a block of that disk and in theory the antivirus should take
> some action (considering that it has the real time enabled), we could
> define it as a file manipulation (still not running) where the
> endpoint protection is already necessary, considering that a new
> directory was created, soon we would have a new repository with
> several hashes inside to be examined..
>
> After performing this second test, we saw that the same 4 malwares
> there were detected yet, as we can see below and mentioned earlier,
> all these malware were already known and validated even in the tool
> about antivirus scanning known as a Virus Total
> ([https://virustotal.com](https://virustotal.com.br)).

### 3.4 Third Test 

> The third stage of the tests was through the use of the *ScanNow*
> action by Cloud Sophos, to perform a complete scan on the machine,
> manually, in this way, all malware should be eliminated, as they are
> already known malware as mentioned earlier.

> **Image 1.9:** Malwares -- Not Detected after *ScanNow*
>
> After performing this third test and the execution of the ScanNow
> feature, we saw that the same 4 malwares there were detected yet, as
> we can see below and mentioned earlier, even all these malwares were
> already known.

# Corrective Actions

> As we mentioned before, the idea it was execute test in many malwares,
> and this case, for this reason to be totally known the following
> actions will be taken to improve the protection environment of our
> assets:

-   This report will be sent to Sophos Security Team to validate with
    them how the detection flow for known malware works, and why these 4
    malwares didn\'t were detect;

-   Validate the performance of NGAV, Machine Learning and other
    components, regarding this type of detection;

-   The best practices of the configurations will be revalidated with
    the Sophos team;
